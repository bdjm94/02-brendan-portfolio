# My Portfolio

## Purpose

The purpose of this Portfolio page is to show potential employers what I have been working on. It will be an easy to access location with all my work.

## Goal

I decided to create a shell of a portfolio that I can later add on and continue to improve as my skills also improve. I have incorporated some of the elements I have learnt in the first two weeks of the Coding Bootcamp course, including website responsiveness, grid styling and flexbox styling.

## Navigation Bar

Simple navigation bar with a "Welcome!" and links to each of the sections. Also has a "Resume" option which allows the user (potential employer) to access a copy of my resume.

## Professional Portfolio

This section is just a little about me with a picture of myself. The picture has been styled to have rounded edges to give it a cleaner look.

## Work Section

The work section was tricky. I started off with having one large image and then using the grid styling below to have different images laid out. These images are all hyperlinked and when completed, they will take you to the relevant github repositories where my work is on display. Right now, the Code Refractor is the only one that links to a proper github repository, with the rest linking to my github landing page. This section does have responsive elements, so as the page width gets smaller, the images will start to stack ontop of each other.

## Contact Section

The contact section includes relevant links to my email, phone number, github, linkedin and instagram. The icon images were sourced from Font Awesome. Clicking on the email icon will allow you to email myself directly. Clicking on the phone icon will allow you to call me from the webpage. The last three icons will take you to my relevant webpages.
